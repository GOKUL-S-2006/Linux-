🔹 Level 1
🎯 Goal

Read the password from a file named - in the home directory.

❌ Common Mistake
cat -


This fails because - represents standard input (stdin) in Linux.

✅ Correct Solution
cat ./-

🧠 Explanation

Filenames starting with - are treated as command options

./ explicitly tells the shell that - is a filename in the current directory

This removes ambiguity and allows cat to read the file correctly

The output is the password for bandit2.
