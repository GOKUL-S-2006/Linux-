🎯 Goal

Find the password for the next level.
The password is stored in one human-readable file among several files that all start with -.

🧩 Problem

All files:

Start with - (can be misinterpreted as options)

Contain different types of data

Only one file contains ASCII (text) data

✅ Solution
Step 1: Identify the readable file
file ./-file*


This checks the type of every file safely.

Step 2: Read the ASCII text file
cat ./-fileXX


(XX is the file number shown as ASCII text in the previous command)

🧠 Explanation

Filenames starting with - must be accessed using ./ or --

The file command identifies file contents without opening them

Only the file marked ASCII text contains the password
