Password is in a file somewhere under inhere/ with all of these properties:

human-readable

exactly 1033 bytes

not executable

This is a textbook use-case for find.

❌ Wrong approach (what you started doing)

Manually entering:

cd maybehere00
ls
cd maybehere01
ls
...


This is:

Slow

Error-prone

Against the Linux philosophy

✅ Correct Solution (ONE command)

Run this from inside inhere:

find . -type f -size 1033c ! -executable

🧠 What this command means (simple)
Part	Meaning
find .	search starting here
-type f	only files (not directories)
-size 1033c	exactly 1033 bytes (c = bytes)
! -executable	NOT executable

This narrows hundreds of files → exactly one.

🔍 Next step: verify it’s readable

You’ll get output like:

./maybehere07/.file2


Now check and read it:

file ./maybehere07/.file2
cat ./maybehere07/.file2


The output is the password for bandit6.

🧠 Why this is powerful

You just learned:

Recursive searching

Filtering by size

Filtering by permissions

How sysadmins find files on real servers

This is real Linux skill, not a puzzle trick.

📌 GitHub-ready writeup (clean & short)
## Bandit Level 5

The password is stored somewhere under `inhere/` and is:
- human-readable
- exactly 1033 bytes
- not executable

Solution:
bandit5@bandit:~/inhere$ find . -type f -size 1033c ! -executable
./maybehere07/.file2
bandit5@bandit:~/inhere$ cat ./maybehere07/.file2

This uses `find` to filter files by size and permissions instead of manual searching.
